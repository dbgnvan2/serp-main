# SERP Intelligence Tool

Market intelligence tool for Living Systems Counselling (livingsystems.ca),
a Bowen Family Systems Theory nonprofit in North Vancouver, BC. Scrapes
Google SERPs via SerpAPI, generates content briefs via Anthropic API, scores
keyword feasibility via Domain Authority gap analysis.

## Always do this

- **Activate venv first**: `source venv/bin/activate` before any Python
  command. Tests and scripts will fail in confusing ways without it.
- **Run tests with**: `python3 -m pytest test_*.py tests/ -q`
  (expects 407 passing, 5 skipped, 0 errors).
- **Never `git add .`** — the repo accumulates output and draft files that
  must stay local. Only commit files intentionally changed for the current
  chunk.
- **Push after each logical chunk** of work (feature module + tests,
  validation rule + tests, doc update). Don't accumulate sweeping diffs.
- **Separate business logic tests from UI tests**: Business logic (data loading,
  validation, structure) should NOT require GUI frameworks. Only skip tests that
  actually need widget interaction. This prevents hidden bugs from going untested.
  Example: Don't skip "test that validates loaded data" just because treeview
  rendering isn't available — that test has nothing to do with the UI.

## Required env vars (in `.env`)

- `SERPAPI_KEY` — required for SERP fetching.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required for content brief generation.
- `DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` + `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD` — primary DA provider
  (pay-per-use).
- `MOZ_TOKEN` — fallback DA provider (free tier: 50 rows/month).

Tests do not require API keys — all external calls are mocked.

## Output naming

`market_analysis_{topic}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMM}.{json,xlsx,md}` plus
`competitor_handoff_{topic}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMM}.json`.

Topic slug derives from the keyword CSV filename (lowercase, spaces →
underscores). The GUI auto-updates `config.yml` with the latest paths.

## Configuration files

- `config.yml` — operational settings. See `docs/config_reference.md` for
  the full key list.
- `domain_overrides.yml` — manual entity-type overrides
  (e.g. `psychologytoday.com: directory`).
- `intent_mapping.yml` — SERP intent rule table (spec v2). First-match-wins,
  top of file = highest priority. Edit this file to refine intent rules; do
  not push exceptions into Python.
- `clinical_dictionary.json` — Bowen vs medical-model vocabulary tiers.
- `strategic_patterns.yml` — Bowen pattern definitions (triggers, reframes, content angles). Add patterns here; no Python required.

## Editorial content lives in config files

Trigger words, classification rules, mapping tables, vocabulary lists,
brief routing rules, and any other content that requires editorial judgment
to refine belongs in YAML or JSON, not in Python source.

When adding a new editorial knob (a new trigger list, a new mapping table,
a new routing rule), check whether similar editorial content already exists
elsewhere in the codebase. If so, externalise the older content in the same
change. Do not leave old hardcoded content in place while new content moves to
YAML — this produces a codebase where similar things live in different places
and reviewers can't find the editorial surface.

Test for "is this editorial content?": if a non-developer reading the file
might reasonably want to change a value (a trigger word, a category label,
a routing rule), it's editorial. If only a developer would touch it (a
class structure, a function signature, an algorithm), it's code.

Editorial content currently lives in:
- `intent_mapping.yml` — SERP intent rule table
- `strategic_patterns.yml` — Bowen patterns (triggers, status quo, reframes)
- `url_pattern_rules.yml` — URL pattern fallbacks for content classifier
- `domain_overrides.yml` — manual entity-type overrides
- `classification_rules.json` — content type and entity type pattern lists
- `clinical_dictionary.json` — Bowen vs medical vocabulary tiers
- `brief_pattern_routing.yml` — brief PAA / keyword / intent-slot routing (added I.1)
- `intent_classifier_triggers.yml` — PAA External Locus / Systemic vocabularies (added I.2)
- `config.yml` — operational settings

When in doubt, ask the user before adding new editorial content to a `.py` file.

## Reference documentation

For details, read these as needed (do not preload):

- `docs/architecture.md` — module map and data flow diagram.
- `docs/database.md` — SQLite schema and tables.
- `docs/api_modes.md` — Low API / Balanced / Deep Research modes.
- `docs/feasibility.md` — DA scoring thresholds and pivot logic.
- `docs/spec_v2_fields.md` — pre-computed `serp_intent`, `title_patterns`,
  `mixed_intent_strategy` fields and their validators.
- `docs/gui_steps.md` — `serp-me.py` GUI step reference.
- `docs/intent_classification.md` — PAA External Locus / Systemic / General
  tagging.
- `docs/config_reference.md` — `config.yml` keys.

## LLM validation policy

`generate_content_brief.py` validates LLM outputs before writing:

- **HARD-fail (abort)**: AI Overview count mismatch versus extracted data;
  `serp_intent.primary_intent` or `is_mixed` contradictions.
- **SOFT-fail (1 retry)**: wording issues, `title_patterns.dominant_pattern`
  contradictions, `mixed_intent_strategy` contradictions. Retry uses the
  correction prompt.
- Failed validations are written to `*.validation.md` for inspection.

`test_validation_consistency.py` is a canary that scans the prompt files
for `keyword_profiles.<field>` references and asserts each has a
corresponding rule in `validate_llm_report`. Run it after adding any new
pre-computed field to a keyword profile to catch missed validators early.

## Methodology doc is a contract

When modifying any file referenced in `docs/methodology.md`, update that doc
in the same change. The methodology doc is part of the contract, not a side
artifact — it must stay in sync with the code it describes.

## Spec traceability for this project

This project uses spec IDs throughout. When working from a spec:

- The `serp_tools_upgrade_spec_v2.md` and follow-up fix specs live in
  the repo root (not `docs/specs/`).
- Code that implements a spec criterion includes a `Spec:` reference in
  its docstring per the user-level workflow rules.
- After any spec-driven change, regenerate `docs/spec_coverage.md` to
  reflect current implementation status.
