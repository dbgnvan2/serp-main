~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Competitive-gap and hyper-local pivot logic for the SERP intelligence tool.

Two public functions:

    compute_feasibility(client_da, competitor_das)
        Given the client's Domain Authority and a list of competitor DAs from
        the top-10 organic results, return a structured feasibility assessment.

    generate_hyper_local_pivot(primary_keyword, non_profit_location,
                               feasibility_results, neighborhoods, strategy)
        When a keyword is "Low Feasibility", suggest a hyper-local neighbourhood
        variant that is likely to have a smaller DA gap.

This module is intentionally free of I/O and project-specific imports so it
can be tested in isolation and reused without side effects.

    When a city-wide keyword is dominated by high-authority directories the
    non-profit cannot match their DA.  Appending a specific neighbourhood
    (e.g. "Lonsdale") narrows the competitive set to locally-present businesses
    and activates Google's neighbourhood-intent ranking signals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    primary_keyword:
        The root service keyword, e.g. ``"Couples Counselling"``.
    non_profit_location:
        Broad location used in the original keyword, e.g. ``"North Vancouver"``.
        Used in the strategy explanation text only.
    feasibility_results:
        Dict containing at minimum ``"status"`` and ``"avg_competitor_da"``
        keys, as returned by :func:`compute_feasibility`.
    neighborhoods:
        Ordered list of neighbourhood names to use as pivot candidates.
        Sourced from ``config.yml → feasibility.neighborhoods``.
    strategy:
        How to pick the suggested neighbourhood:

        ``"first"`` *(default)* — deterministic, always picks ``neighborhoods[0]``.
        Use this in production so repeated runs on the same data yield the
        same report.

        ``"all"`` — ``suggested_keyword`` is the first variant; ``all_variants``
        contains every neighbourhood combination.

        ``"random"`` — non-deterministic pick.  Useful for demos; **do not**
        use as the pipeline default because it makes test assertions brittle.
