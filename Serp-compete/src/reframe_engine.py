A competitor page ({competitor_url}) is winning on the keyword '{keyword}' using a "Medical Model" approach (Medical Score: {medical_score}).

Your task is to draft a "Pattern-First" content reframe blueprint (approx 500 words).

### Instructions:
1. **Identify the Anxiety Loop:** How does the medical model reinforce chronic anxiety? Use the following PAA questions to demonstrate the user's 'Label-Seeking' behavior:
{paa_context}
Explain how these questions represent an 'Anxiety Loop' where the user seeks a diagnostic label to lower the intensity of the relationship process.

2. **The Systemic Reframe:** Shift the focus from individual pathology to the relationship system. Focus specifically on: {remapped_focus}.
Example: If the user is asking 'Am I avoidant?' (Anxiety Loop), shift this to 'How is distance being used to regulate anxiety in the relationship?' (Systemic Reframe).

3. **Bowen Concepts:** Apply concepts like Differentiation of Self, Triangles, and the Multigenerational Emotional Process.

4. **Differentiation Strategy:** Why is a Bowen approach more effective for long-term functioning than individual 'tips and tools'?
